Includes:

- Client
- Server (Uses most of the B4 features)
- MWord Editor, universal world editor that generates binary maps.
- MGUI, an optimized UI solution for Unity3D

NOTE: Launching the client twice (or more) from the same Folder will lead to IO exceptions while loading maps, it not recommended to do so.
